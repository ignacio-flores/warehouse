        "abstract": "We estimate the distribution of wealth in Italy between 1995 and 2016 using a novel source of inheritance tax files, combined with surveys and national accounts. We find that the level of wealth concentration is in line with other European countries; however, its time trend appears more in line with the US, showing a significant increase over the period studied. The country exhibits one of the greatest declines in the wealth share of the bottom 50\\%. The paper also shows that age plays a marginal role in explaining wealth concentration. Changes in savings, instead, are the predominant force behind the increase in wealth inequality, even at the top. Equity prices also account for a large share of wealth growth above the 99th percentile, whereas changes in house prices play only a minor role. Finally, we document the growing concentration of life-time wealth transfers, and their increasingly favorable tax treatment.",

But data deficiencies are a major barrier in understanding the true distribution, composition and size of household wealth. The most comprehensive survey of household wealth in the UK does a good job of capturing the vast majority of the wealth distribution, but nearly {\\pounds}800 billion of wealth held by the very wealthiest UK households is missing. We also find tentative evidence that survey measures of high-wealth families undervalue their assets -- our central estimate of the true value of wealth held by households in the UK is 5 per cent higher than the survey data suggest.",

        "abstract": "German history over the past 125 years has been turbulent. Marked by two world wars, revolutions and major regime changes, as well as a hyperinflation and three currency reforms, expropriations and territorial divisions, it provides unique insights into the role of country-specific shocks in shaping long-run wealth dynamics. This paper presents the first comprehensive study of wealth and its distribution in Germany since the 19th century. We combine tax and archival data, household surveys, historical national accounts, and rich lists to analyze the evolution of the German wealth distribution over the long run. We show that the top 1\\% wealth share has fallen by half, from close to 50\\% in 1895 to 27\\% today. Nearly all of this decline was the result of changes that occurred between 1914 and 1952. The interwar period and the wealth taxation in the aftermath of World War II stand out as the great equalizers in 20th century German history. After unification in 1990, two trends have left their mark on the German wealth distribution. Households at the top made substantial capital gains from rising business wealth while the middle-class had large capital gains in the housing market. The wealth share of the bottom 50\\% halved since 1990. Our findings speak to the importance of historical shocks to the distribution and valuations of existing wealth in explaining the evolution of the wealth distribution over the long run.",

        "abstract": "Recent research highlighted controversy about the evolution of concentration of personal wealth. In this paper we provide new evidence about the long-run evolution of top wealth shares for the United Kingdom. The new series covers a long period -- from 1895 to the present -- and has a different point of departure from the previous literature: we start with the analysis of the distribution of estates left at death. We find that the application to the estate data of mortality multipliers to yield estimates of wealth among the living does not substantially change the degree of concentration over much of the period both in the UK and US, allowing inferences to be made for years when this method cannot be applied. The results show that wealth concentration in the UK remained relatively constant during the first wave of globalization, but then decreased dramatically in the period from 1914 to 1979. The UK went from being more unequal in terms of wealth than the US to being less unequal. However, the decline in UK wealth concentration came to an end around 1980, and since then there is evidence of an increase in top shares, notably in the distribution of wealth excluding housing in recent years. We investigate the triangulating evidence provided by data on capital income concentration and on reported super fortunes.",

        "abstract": "Recently released official survey data show a decline in wealth inequality (measured by the Gini) and wealth concentration (shares of the top fractiles) over 2012-2018. We investigate a puzzling detail -- the rich hold equities, whose prices increased over 2012-2018, while the middle class holds precious metals, whose prices declined over the same period. The survey predicts the richest Indian to be worth Rs 244 million in 2018; according to glossy magazine covers, the richest Indian has, in fact, a net worth of Rs 2,560 billion. We correct this series using data from named rich lists and find that the decline in wealth inequality is more modest. More strikingly, we find a sharp increase in wealth concentration, with the share of the Top 0.001 percent doubling in size -- as of 2018, the wealth of the richest 7000 (approx.) Indians exceeds the wealth of the poorest 50 percent.",

I find that income is extremely concentrated over the 2005-2014 period: The top 1 and 10 percent of the adult population received almost 25 and 55 percent of national income on average, placing Lebanon among the countries with the highest levels of income inequality in the world. Results are robust to sensitivity analysis and suggest that one should not give up on tracking the dynamics of wealth and income concentration in a developing country, as long as the the assumptions made are clearly and systematically stated. The extreme level on inequality found question the long-lasting narrative of the \"Lebanese economic miracle\" that showcases the country as a paragon of economic success in the Middle East. They also confirm results from a large literature that emphasizes how the Lebanese sectarian-based mode of governance has allowed the ruling elite to extract large rents on most economic activities in the last decades at the expense of the majority of citizens.",

We show, among other things, that 60\\% of the super-rich are heirs---a fraction twice as large as in the US---and that wealth mobility at the very top has declined significantly. We find that top 0.01\\% wealth shares are higher than previous estimates based on wealth tax statistics suggest. At the same time, we argue that rich list data lead to overestimating wealth inequality. While rich lists are valuable to study the super-rich, we recommend to use reported wealth figures with caution.",

The DFAs complement other existing sources of data on the wealth distribution by using a more comprehensive measure of household wealth and by providing quarterly data on a timely basis.

E.g. the top 10\\% wealth share rose from 45\\% in year 1981 to 68\\% in 2012, while the top 1\\% share rose from 27\\% to 41\\%. Next, I gather information from censuses and surveys (NSS AIDIS and consumption, IHDS, NFHS) in order to explore the changing relationship between class and caste in India and the mechanisms behind rising inequality. Assortative mating appears to be very high in India, both at the caste level and at the education level (though not hugely larger than than in Western countries at the education level). I stress the limits of our knowledge and indicate possible lines of future research, particularly regarding the interplay between assortative mating and inequality dynamics.",

        "abstract": "The revenue importance of taxes on net wealth and capital transfers is diminishing almost everywhere. In general, however, those developed countries with such taxes show no sign of abandoning them. The main exceptions are Australia and Canada, which have never had net wealth taxes and which have, like a number of developing countries, abolished death taxes. Although Canada has further emulated some developing countries by introducing a new wealth tax on corporations, only a major political change (like the election of socialist governments in France and Spain) seems likely to result in the reintroduction of direct taxes on personal wealth in this country.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the interaction between the long-term dynamics of aggregate household wealth and the wealth distribution in Europe and the United States. We do so by building the first Distributional Wealth Accounts for Europe, including households' assets, liabilities, investment flows, and the wealth distribution for most European countries from 1970--2020. We find that although aggregate household wealth to income ratios have followed a similar increasing pattern in both Europe and the United States since 1970, wealth concentration has increased much faster in the United States. Using wealth accumulation decompositions and counterfactual simulations, we show that the weaker rise in labor income inequality and the stronger rise in house prices relative to financial assets in Europe versus the United States appear to explain why Europe has experienced a more moderate rise in wealth concentration since the mid-1980s.",

First, the evolution of household portfolios over the last forty years is described on the basis of newly reconstructed aggregate balance sheets. Second, the characteristics and quality of the main statistical source on wealth distribution, the Bank of Italy's Survey of Household Income and Wealth, are examined to-gether with the statistical procedures used to adjust for non-response, non-reporting and under-reporting. The distribution of household net worth is then studied using both adjusted and unad-justed data. Wealth inequality is found to have risen steadily during the 1990s. The increased con-centration of financial wealth was an important factor in determining this path.",

Household surveys are the traditional data source used to measure the top shares, but recent studies using administrative tax records suggest that these survey-based top share estimates may not be capturing all of the increasing concentration. In this paper, we reconcile the divergent top share estimates, showing how the choices of data sets and methodological decisions affect levels and trends. Relative to the new and most widely cited top share estimates based on administrative tax data alone, our preferred estimates for both wealth and income concentration are lower and have been rising less rapidly in recent years.",

We develop a comprehensive framework that modifies the SCF to recover the wealth distribution over families, tax units, and individuals from 1989 to 2019. We show that, by ignoring unequal holdings within families, existing estimates considerably understate U.S. inequality across individuals. We find wealth concentration rose through the recent economic recovery, which differs from leading models that capitalize income into wealth even after aligning conceptual differences. We illustrate that private businesses are a growing impediment to accurately modeling wealth from income.",

        "abstract": "The research seeks to examine the nature, scope and implementation of property taxation systems in Europe. The paper builds upon research carried out in 1999/2000 by the authors (under the David C. Lincoln Fellowship programme) in respect of 24 countries. This paper expands the coverage to some 42 countries but also widens the study to include an overview of government organisation within those countries. It also includes a brief description of the main sources of local government finance. It first considers the main types of property taxation that can be found in Europe such as annual property taxes, inheritance taxes, value added tax etc. and attempts in a series of tables to compare the main features of each tax as adopted in the countries studied. It then considers the background to the property taxation and deals with issues such as the current tax reforms that are being currently undertaken within Europe. It then outlines the impact of such changes for all aspects of property taxation. Consideration is then given to some of the key generic features of the systems implemented across Europe -- the nature of the taxpayer, basis of valuation, exemptions, appeals etc. with a particular emphasis on annual property taxes. The final and major part of the work describes the current knowledge of around 190 the individual taxes, duties and levies as applied in the 42 countries studied.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides a reconstruction of the joint distribution of income and wealth among Italians in the years ranging from 1968 to 1975. By exploiting the information available in some historical reports recently published by the Bank of Italy, the paper reconstructs synthetic microdata compatible with the aggregate results of sample surveys carried out in those years. In this way, inequality and poverty can be estimated by using the same statistical criteria that are used today, making possible an intertemporal comparison of the estimates. The concentration of household wealth shows a downward trend in the 1970s and 1980s, an increase in the years following the 1992-1993 crisis and a relative stability in the new century. In the period 1968-1975 the concentration of wealth turns out to have been higher than in recent years. The estimates of relative poverty, calculated by using both indicators of equivalent income and indicators that combine income and wealth, show a decreasing trend until the 1990s and a subsequent increase; the upward trend of these indicators in recent years is steeper than that of the concentration indices. The poverty indicators that take wealth into account have reached levels similar to those observed in the period 1968-1975. Migration flows have significantly contributed to the recent growth in the poverty indices.",

        "abstract": "How wealth has accumulated in the region and how is it distributed across households? Despite being widely recognized for its extreme income inequality, reliable data on wealth is scarce, partial and oftentimes contradictory, making it difficult to answer these basic questions. In this study, we estimate aggregates based on macroeconomic data, and inequality based on recently available surveys. We contrast our results with the literature, with a handful of state-of-the-art estimates from administrative sources, and with more available but extrapolated estimates from Credit Suisse and wid.world. Considering all the evidence, we distinguish reliable facts from what can only be conjectured or speculated. We find that aggregate wealth increased over two decades in four countries, now ranging close to 3.5 the national income for market value estimates and 5-6 times at book values. We also find that wealth inequality is amongst the highest in the world were it can be measured. Given data limitations, one can only speculate about aggregates in opaque countries and about inequality trends in any country in the region. Although recent research in the developed world has focused in combining data sources to better understand wealth, the region lags behind and urgently requires more and better public information.",

        "abstract": "Recent influential work finds large increases in inequality in the U.S. based on measures of wealth concentration that notably exclude the value of social insurance programs. This paper revisits this conclusion by incorporating Social Security retirement benefits into measures of wealth inequality. We find that top wealth shares have not increased in the last three decades when Social Security is properly accounted for. This finding is robust to assumptions about how taxes and benefits may change in response to system financing concerns. When discounted at the risk-free rate, real Social Security wealth increased substantially from \\$4.8 trillion in 1989 to \\$41.3 trillion in 2016. When we adjust the discount rate for long-run macroeconomic risk, this increase remains sizable, growing from over \\$3.9 trillion in 1989 to \\$33.9 trillion in 2016. Consequently, by 2016, Social Security wealth represents 57\\% of the wealth of the bottom 90\\% of the wealth distribution.",

        "abstract": "This article estimates the distribution of personal wealth in South Africa by combining microdata covering the universe of income tax returns, household surveys, and macroeconomic balance sheet statistics. South Africa is characterized by unparalleled levels of wealth concentration. The top 10 percent own 86 percent of aggregate wealth and the top 0.1 percent close to one-third. The top 0.01 percent of the distribution (3,500 individuals) concentrate 15 percent of household net worth, more than the bottom 90 percent as a whole. Such levels of inequality can be accounted for in all forms of assets at the top end, including housing, pension funds, and financial assets. There has been no sign of decreasing inequality since the end of apartheid.",

        "abstract": "Over the past 18 months, research for the Intergenerational Commission has illustrated how the assumption that each generation will do better than the one before it is under pressure. This paper is one of a series that moves beyond the diagnosis of these problems to consider what action is needed to address generational living standards challenges. In this paper, our focus is inheritance taxation. With inheritances growing rapidly in importance at the same time as fiscal pressures, inheritance taxation must play its role in raising revenue in a fair way. But the current Inheritance Tax system manages to raise relatively little while also being especially unpopular. It is seen as unfair for three main reasons: taxing giving is seen as a bad thing, as is the tax's explicit link to death; it has a high rate; and it is seen as easy for the richest to avoid due to its wide range of exemptions. This paper proposes a Lifetime Receipts Tax that would address these problems while also encouraging individuals to spread their wealth wider and raising revenue to help fix Britain's intergenerational contract.",

Research for the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Databook has been undertaken on behalf of the Credit Suisse Research Institute by Professors Anthony Shorrocks and Jim Davies, recognized authorities on this topic, and the architects and principal authors of \"Personal Wealth from a Global Perspective,\" Oxford University Press, 2008. The aim of the Credit Suisse Global Wealth project is to provide the best available estimates of the wealth holdings of households around the world for the period since the year 2000. While the Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report highlights the main findings of our study, the 128-page Databook underlines the extent of our analysis. More importantly, it sets out in detail the data employed in our Global Wealth project, the methodology used to calculate estimates of wealth and how this may differ from other reports in this field. The Credit Suisse Global Wealth Databook also details the evolution of household wealth levels through the period 2000 to 2010, providing data at the regional level on high net worth individuals, and highlighting the wealth pyramid in addition to wealth analysis for 160 countries. Finally, the Databook presents detailed data on relatively under-researched areas such as gender and the composition of household portfolios (assets and debts).",

During the 12 months up to end-2020, and in spite of the economic disruption caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, we estimate that aggregate global wealth has risen by USD 28.7 trillion (+7.4\\%) to a combined total of USD 418.3 trillion. Wealth per adult grew by 6\\% to a new record high of USD 79,952 per adult. The core reason for the apparent disconnect between the ongoing global recession in 2020 and household wealth is the pre-emptive action taken by governments and central banks, and the rapid development of COVID vaccines, which combined led to a strong rally in financial assets.

        "abstract": "Despite their significance for economic activity, precise and comprehensive insights into the levels and the global distribution of wealth remain scarce. The Global Wealth Report, issued annually by the Credit Suisse Research Institute, is one of the key sources of intelligence in relation to global wealth development, and delivers extensive estimates of global household wealth levels, covering all regions and population segments. Our seventh edition of the Global Wealth Report confirms a course of the weak global wealth growth. In the course the past 12 months, global wealth has risen by USD 3.5 trillion to USD 256 trillion, which represents an increase of 1.4\\%. However, wealth creation has merely kept pace with population growth. As a result, in 2016, wealth per adult was unchanged for the first time since 2008, at approximately USD 52,800. Among the major economies, the USA and Japan were able to generate substantial additional wealth, while the United Kingdom recorded a significant decline as a result of currency depreciation. Since 2008, we have reported on gains in household wealth being driven by an increase in financial assets. Interestingly, we are observing a shift in 2016, as the share of non-financial assets increased for the first time. In total, USD 4.9 trillion were added to real assets, compared to a USD 330 billion rise in financial assets. We have further established that wealth inequality, measured by the share of the wealthiest 1\\% and wealthiest 10\\% of adults, as compared to the rest of the world's adult population, continues to rise. While the bottom half collectively own less than 1\\% of total wealth, the wealthiest top 10\\% own 89\\% of all global assets. Since the beginning of the century, emerging economies have significantly influenced the global allocation of wealth. In 2000, emerging economies accounted for a mere 12\\% of global wealth, but have contributed nearly 25\\% towards global growth since. Today, emerging nations are home to 18\\% of the world's ultra-high net worth population. China alone accounts for 9\\% of the top decile of global wealth holders, which is well above France, Germany, Italy, and the United Kingdom. Besides the recurring themes, our 2016 edition of the Global Wealth Report sheds light on the most significant trends at the bottom of the global wealth pyramid. Currently, an estimated 9\\% of adults globally are net debtors, which is without a doubt a worrying development. In our report, we provide insights into the regional composition of this segment, explore structural factors associated with poverty, and estimate the assets owned by the lower wealth segments. We trust that you will find our report insightful.",

        "abstract": "The Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report is the most extensive and current source of information on global household wealth. Now in its ninth edition, the report not only provides insights into the wealth development of regions and segments, but for the first time it also focuses on the most recent evidence on female wealth holdings, in particular on gender differences with males. During the 12 months since our last report to mid-2018, aggregate global wealth rose by USD 14 trillion to USD 317 trillion, which represents a growth rate of approximately 4.6\\%. This growth rate was lower than last year, but higher than the average growth rate in the post-2008 era. This was sufficient to outpace population growth, so that wealth per adult grew by approximately 3.2\\%, a record high. Looking at the number of millionaires, we see that there are 42.2 million millionaires worldwide, which is up 2.3 million over the previous 12 months. Our research indicates that the United States added 878,000 new millionaires -- representing around 40\\% of the global increase -- to its already sizable stock, whereas the number of newcomers in France, Germany, the United Kingdom and Italy was around 200,000 each. In China, the number of millionaires rose by a modest 186,000 and in Japan 94,000. The main explanation for these increases in millionaire numbers within countries lies in the real wealth growth, rather than in exchange-rate movements. Millionaire numbers fell in very few countries (such as Turkey and Brazil), and by relatively small amounts, the main driver being currency depreciation. The key finding of this year's new wealth valuation is for many observers not surprising -- China is now clearly established second place in the world wealth hierarchy. The country overtook Japan with respect to the number of ultra-high net worth (UHNW) individuals in 2009, total wealth in 2011 and the number of millionaires in 2014. Nevertheless, the data shows that mean wealth per adult in China (USD 47,810 in mid-2018) remains far below the level in Japan (USD 227,240). Turning our interest to the lower level of the wealth distribution, we see that 3.2 billion adults or about 64\\% of the adult population lives with a wealth below USD 10,000, which corresponds to only 1.9\\% of the global wealth. Those with low wealth are disproportionately found among the younger age groups, those who live in regions where prospects for wealth creation are very limited (most notably Africa) and where opportunities are sometimes constrained. The wealth of women has been receiving increasing attention and we estimate that women account for about 40\\% of global wealth overall. During the 20th century, their share of wealth rose considerably and, since the year 2000, the level of women's wealth has risen along with all household wealth, especially in Asia alongside the rise of China's wealth. The tendency shows that more self-made women are succeeding in business and are entering the highest wealth ranks. Despite this trend, even in those countries where progress is the strongest, some categories of women -- such as single mothers and divorcees -- remain disadvantaged. While more is required to be done to ensure that women have an equal opportunity to build up, inherit and share in wealth, there are signs that progress has been happening in many parts of the world. Given some of this year's intriguing findings, we hope you find the 2018 edition of the Global Wealth Report a valuable source of insight and wish you interesting reading.",

        "abstract": "Ten years ago, the Credit Suisse Research Institute launched the first Global wealth report providing the most comprehensive and up-to date survey of household wealth. Since then the Global wealth report has become the standard reference point to monitor wealth growth across countries and the extent to which wealth inequalities are widening or narrowing. For the past decade, global wealth creation has centered around China and the United States. This year, the United States extended its unbroken spell of wealth gains, which began after the global financial crisis in 2008. The United States also accounts for 40\\% of dollar millionaires worldwide and for 40\\% of those in the top 1\\% of global wealth distribution. Wealth in China started the century from a lower base, but grew at a much faster pace during the early years. It was one of the few countries to avoid the impact of the global financial crisis. China's progress has enabled it to replace Europe as the principal source of global wealth growth and to replace Japan as the country with the second-largest number of millionaires. More tellingly, China overtook the United States this year to become the country with most people in the top 10\\% of global wealth distribution. The rest of the world has not stood still. Other emerging markets -- India in particular -- have made a steady contribution, which we expect to continue over the next five years. However, overall worldwide growth was modest in the 12 months up to mid-2019. Aggregate global wealth rose by USD 9.1 trillion to USD 360.6 trillion, representing a growth rate of 2.6\\%. Wealth per adult grew by just 1.2\\% to USD 70,850 per adult in mid-2019. The number of new millionaires was also relatively modest, up 1.1 million to 46.8 million. The United States added 675,000 newcomers, more than half of the global total. Japan and China each contributed more than 150,000, but Australia lost 124,000 millionaires following a fall in average wealth. To mark its tenth anniversary, this year's report examines in more detail the underlying factors for the evolution of wealth levels and wealth distribution. The growth records of countries can be quite different depending on whether wealth is measured in US dollars or domestic currencies, or in nominal or inflation-adjusted units. In the longer term, the most successful countries are those that succeed in raising wealth as a multiple of Gross Domestic Product (GDP) by addressing institutional and financial-sector deficiencies. This can result in a virtuous cycle in which higher wealth stimulates GDP growth, which in turn raises aggregate wealth. China, India and Vietnam provide examples of this virtuous cycle in action. Second, the report looks at the evolution of wealth inequality. The bottom half of wealth holders collectively accounted for less than 1\\% of total global wealth in mid-2019, while the richest 10\\% own 82\\% of global wealth and the top 1\\% alone own 45\\%. Global inequality fell during the first part of this century when a narrowing of gaps between countries was reinforced by declining inequality within countries. While advances by emerging markets continued to narrow the gaps between countries, inequality within countries grew as economies recovered after the global financial crisis. As a result, the top 1\\% of wealth holders increased their share of world wealth. This trend appears to have abated in 2016 and global inequality is now likely to edge downward in the immediate future. Given some of this year's intriguing findings, we hope you will find the Global wealth report 2019 a valuable source of information and wish you interesting reading.",

        "abstract": "The COVID-19 pandemic has had a huge impact on regions all around the globe and affected people's lives in countless ways. How it has impacted wealth and the distribution of wealth is the subject of this special Credit Suisse Global Wealth Report 2020. Given the difficulties encountered in assembling our full dataset in these turbulent times, we have chosen to publish an interim edition of the Global Wealth Report for 2020. We will publish a full edition in the second quarter of 2021, providing further insights into the impact of the pandemic on global wealth. Whereas 2019 was a year of tremendous wealth creation -- total global wealth rose by USD 36.3 trillion during the year -- our experts estimate total household wealth dropped by USD 17.5 trillion between January and March. From March onward, stock markets have rebounded and house prices have soared, and the data available for Q2 2020 suggests that household wealth is roughly back to the level at the end of last year. Lower economic growth for some time and changes in corporate and consumer behavior will result not only in lost output, but also in redundant facilities as well as sectoral changes that may restrain household wealth accumulation for many years. Thus our authors believe that household wealth will, at best, recover slowly from the pandemic throughout 2021. Among major economies, only China is projected to see material gains in wealth over the period. Without the pandemic, our experts' best estimate of global wealth per adult would have risen from USD 77,309 at the start of the year to USD 78,376 at end-June. Instead, the pandemic has caused average wealth to drop to USD 76,984. The most adversely affected region was Latin America, where currency devaluations reinforced reductions in gross domestic product (GDP) to result in a 12.8\\% decline in total wealth in US dollar terms. The pandemic eradicated the expected growth in North America and caused losses in every other region, except China and India. Among the major global economies, the United Kingdom has seen the most notable relative erosion of wealth. The worldwide impact on wealth distribution within countries has been remarkably small given the substantial pandemic-related GDP losses. Indeed, there is no firm evidence that the pandemic has systematically favored broad higher wealth groups over lower-wealth groups or vice versa. Although it is too early to fully assess the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on global wealth distribution, it is notable that the latest data indicate that overall wealth inequality has declined in at least one key country -- the United States. Nevertheless, we are likely to see a differential impact on low-skilled labor, women, minorities and young workers that will require the attention of policymakers. Importantly, the worldwide distribution of wealth will change in response to the changing pattern of household wealth across countries and regions, with China very likely to be among the countries to benefit most. Wealth plays an essential role in household financial resilience and serves as a foundation for broader economic development, especially during times of crisis. We at Credit Suisse remain committed to delivering our financial expertise and experience to all of our clients and stakeholders. I hope readers find the insights of this edition of the Global Wealth Report to be of particular relevance in present times.",

        "abstract": "A gap in estimates of the personal distribution of Canadian wealth between 1902 and 1970 is partly filled, using estate multiplier estimates for 1945--1968. The historical record is extended by adjusting the upper tail in survey results since 1970 to make it consistent with respected journalists' ``rich lists.'' Top wealth shares decline from 1892 to 1902 and from 1945 to the late 1960s, consistent with the downward trend in most advanced western countries over much of the 20th century. Since 1984 there has been a clear upward trend in wealth inequality in Canada, as in many other countries, and in the United States. Currently, wealth inequality is higher in Canada than in the U.K. and much of continental Europe, somewhat lower than Austria or Germany, and distinctly lower than the U.S. Contrasts between Canada and the U.S. in wealth inequality trends are discussed.",

        "abstract": "The wealth distribution is infamously top-heavy, while the decisive upper tail is missing from survey data on household wealth in European countries. We provide a novel quantile regression approach to estimate all parameters of the Pareto and Generalized Pareto distribution to adjust for the rich missing in survey data due to differential non-response and under-reporting. In contrast to existing Pareto-based adjustment routines, the generalized and rules-based method is scalable, flexible in the face of heterogeneities in data quality and wealth accumulation regimes, transparent, and prevents over-shooting of wealth aggregates and wealth concentration estimates. We apply the method to data on fourteen Eurozone countries by supplementing the Household Finance and Consumption Survey (HFCS) with a novel database on country-specific rich lists from the European Rich List Database (ERLDB) compiled from country-specific rich lists. The magnitude of the resulting upper-tail adjustments varies substantially across countries, highlighting the importance of the rules-based method developed here. In addition, while the results are highly stable across an extensive range of sensitivity tests addressing the opacities of ERLDB data, the resulting estimates vary substantially across parameters borrowed from prior work.",

        "abstract": "Although having attracted more attention in recent years, wealth and wealth distributions still play a minor role compared to income distributions in discussions concerning inequalities within and across countries (see, for example, sustainable development goals from the UN; OECD 2015). This article provides an overview of existing data on wealth and wealth taxes around the globe. Firstly, we present data on wealth levels for selected OECD countries and discuss the general difficulties in measuring wealth. Secondly, we investigate the existing net wealth taxation regimes in selected OECD countries. Thirdly, we compare inheritance and gift taxation regimes across the same sample of OECD countries and illustrate that tax regimes differ vastly from one another.",

        "abstract": "This study compares three different categories of taxes on wealth and the transfer of wealth: - Inheritance and gift; - Real estate and land; - Net-wealth. Inheritances are taxed in 20 Member States and gifts in 21. One of the main characteristics of both inheritance and gift taxes is the principle of care between generations whereby the spouse or children are largely exempt from tax. Thus although the tax base is broad and rates can be high, the revenues from inheritance and gift taxes are relatively low. Real estate is taxed in every Member State. Most Member States tax both the possession and the transfer of real estate. Tax rates are on the whole relatively low but there are normally very few exemptions. The main issue with real estate taxes, especially those on the possession of real estate, is the issue of the value for tax purposes. Taxes on net-wealth are rare. Though several countries have (environmental) taxes on the possession of certain assets, only three Member States use net-wealth as a tax base. Taxes on net-wealth are characterized by a relatively large tax free threshold. Thus only a small proportion of the theoretical number of taxpayers is liable to net-wealth tax. This results in a relatively low revenue yield.",

        "abstract": "This study provides estimates of offshore wealth held by individuals (for the world's main economies) and corresponding estimates of international tax evasion (for the EU and EU Member States). Following the literature, the methodology relies on public statistics published by international organisations. Several additions to the standard approach are proposed including (i) estimates of offshore wealth held indirectly through shell companies, based on the identification of ``Type II'' international financial centres (defined as jurisdictions providing shell companies and similar devices); (ii) the use of foreign direct investment data to improve on available statistics for cross-borders deposits. Key results are as follows. The global offshore wealth is estimated at USD 7.8 trillion in 2016 (EUR 7.5 trillion) or 10.4\\% of global GDP, a considerable amount. This estimate is largely consistent with existing published valuations. The EU share is valued at USD 1.6 trillion (EUR 1.5 trillion), or 9.7\\% of GDP. The corresponding EU estimated revenue lost to international tax evasion is EUR 46 billion in 2016 (0.32\\% of GDP). Among Member states, there is a great deal of heterogeneity, both in monetary terms of the estimated offshore wealth (and the corresponding tax evasion) and in GDP percentages of the same.",

Taxpayers need a current guide, such as the Worldwide Personal Tax and Immigration Guide, in such a shifting tax landscape, especially if they are contemplating new markets. The content is straightforward. Chapter by chapter, from Albania to Zimbabwe, we summarize personal tax systems and immigration rules in more than 150 jurisdictions. The content is current as on 1 September 2023 with exceptions noted. Keep up-to-date on significant tax developments around the globe with the EY Global Tax Alert library. Only some of the chapters in this Tax Guide reflect COVID-19 tax policy measures. Each chapter begins with our in-country executive and immigration contact information, and some jurisdictions add contacts from our Private Client Services practice. Then we lay out the essential facts about the jurisdiction's personal taxes. We start with the personal income tax, explaining who is liable for tax and, at some length, what types of income are considered taxable and which rates, deductions and credits apply. A section on other taxes varies by jurisdiction but often includes estate, inheritance, gift and real estate taxes. A social security section covers payments for publicly provided health, pensions and other social benefits, followed by sections on tax filing and payment procedures as well as double tax relief and tax treaties. The immigration sections provide information on temporary visas, work visas and permits, residence visas and permits, and family and personal considerations. At the back of the guide, you will find a list of the names and codes for all national currencies and a list of contacts for other jurisdictions.",

        "abstract": "Die Nettoverm{\\\"o}gen sind viel ungleichm{\\\"a}{\\ss}iger verteilt als die Nettoeinkommen. In den letzten Jahren hat die Ungleichheit der Verm{\\\"o}gensverteilung noch weiter zugenommen. Dies ergeben die beiden Verm{\\\"o}genserhebungen des Sozio-oekonomischen Panels (SOEP) von 2002 und 2007, auf deren Grundlage die Autoren in diesem Band eine Reihe von innovativen Analysen rund um die Verm{\\\"o}gensverteilung pr{\\\"a}sentieren. Sie widmen sich u.a. der -- erstaunlicherweise nicht sehr stringenten -- Korrelation zwischen Nettoeinkommen und -verm{\\\"o}gen, der langfristigen Entwicklung des Gesamtverm{\\\"o}gens des Haushaltssektors mit den Auf- und Abstiegen in der Verm{\\\"o}genshierarchie sowie der Verm{\\\"o}gensverteilung nach Bildungsstand, beruflicher Stellung und Migrationshintergrund. Indem die Untersuchung auch die rechtlichen Eigent{\\\"u}mer erfasst, erlaubt sie einen Einblick in die geschlechtsspezifischen Verm{\\\"o}gensverh{\\\"a}ltnisse -- mit dem Ergebnis, dass M{\\\"a}nner erwartungsgem{\\\"a}{\\ss} deutlich verm{\\\"o}gender sind als Frauen. Erstmals beziehen die Autoren auch die Anwartschaften an Renten und Pensionen in die erweiterte Verm{\\\"o}gensrechnung ein. Das Anwartschaftsverm{\\\"o}gen ist wesentlich weniger ungleich verteilt als das Geld-, Sach- und Beteiligungsverm{\\\"o}gen; die Ungleichheit wird dadurch abgeschw{\\\"a}cht, aber sie bleibt insgesamt eklatant. -- Mit einem Vorwort von Sir Anthony Atkinson.",

This book is designed to inform the current policy debate and build a conceptual basis for future scholarship. The book contains eleven original studies of estate and gift taxes, along with discussants' comments. The essays provide background and historical information; analyze the optimal taxation of estates and gifts; examine the effects of the tax on charitable contributions, saving behavior, the distribution and level of wealth, tax avoidance and tax evasion; and explore the effects of alternatives to estate taxation.",

        "abstract": "Australian wealth shares have known large fluctuations due to asset pricing volatility on Australian financial and housing markets. This paper intends to analyze those fluctuations through the relatively innovative approach that consists in drawing individual income data from aggregated fiscal data and in applying the income capitalization method to derive household wealth. First of all, we show that after an initial drop of top wealth shares up to 1996, the upward housing price dynamic triggered off a sharp increase in top wealth shares in 2003-2004 and a second one in 2006-2007. At the acme, the 1\\% wealthiest individuals owned 20\\% of the total wealth. Secondly, we argue that this period of housing price growth has been marked by the penetration of home-owners in top-wealth groups, which initially included mostly owners of financial assets. Nonetheless, homeowners are no longer present in top-wealth groups above P99. Then, we intend to show that financial instruments, especially stocks, and business assets constitute between 70 and 90\\% of the wealth of the people belonging to the top 0.01\\%. Finally,using the household survey HILDA, we show through non-parametric techniques that the behavior of Australian households is consistent with the life-cycle theory.",

        "abstract": "Measuring and understanding the evolution of wealth inequality is a key challenge for researchers, policy makers, and the general public. This paper breaks new ground on this topic by presenting a new method to estimate and study wealth inequality. This method combines fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts in order to provide annual wealth distribution series, with detailed breakdowns by percentiles, age, and assets. Using the case of France as an illustration, we show that the resulting series can be used to better analyze the evolution and the determinants of wealth-inequality dynamics over the 1970--2014 period. We show that the decline in wealth inequality ends in the early 1980s, marking the beginning of a rise in the top 1\\% wealth share, though with significant fluctuations due largely to asset price movements. Rising inequality in savings rates coupled with highly stratified rates of returns has led to rising wealth concentration in spite of the opposing effect of house price increases. We develop a simple simulation model highlighting how changes in the combination of unequal savings rates, rates of return, and labor earnings that occurred in the early 1980s generated large multiplicative effects that led to radically different steady-state levels of wealth inequality. Taking advantage of the joint distribution of income and wealth, we show that top wealth holders are almost exclusively top capital earners, and increasingly fewer are made up of top labor earners; it has become increasingly difficult in recent decades to access top wealth groups with one's labor income only.",

We argue that revenue requirements are the main determinant of repeal risks: The inheritance tax is resilient as long as it is central to the national revenue system; it becomes vulnerable to attacks once the rise of more efficient tax instruments marginalizes its revenue contribution. Devoid of fiscal purpose, its survival depends mainly on its redistributive features. Redistribution, however, is essentially contested and should be more important in democracies. The evidence is in line with our conjecture: The likelihood of inheritance tax repeal increases as other more buoyant taxes rise and non-democracies are more likely to repeal the tax than democracies.",

The U.S. Census Bureau distributes government finance data that some scholars have utilized, but the difficult process of collecting, interpreting, and organizing the data has led its adoption to be prohibitive and inconsistent. On this website we offer a single, coherent resource that contains all of the census data from 1967 through the most recent update, uses easy to understand natural-language variable names, and can be extended when new data is available. Because of the size of the data, the links below give you the option to download the entire database or only the set of governments you are interested in. Each download link includes a text file of the data, our research paper describing the data, and several appendices to help you work with it.",

The total sample size is composed of more than 83,000 households. Although the survey does not refer to the same time period in all countries, the most common reference period for the data is 2021. The report presents the methodologies applied in areas such as data collection, sample design, weighting, imputation, and variance estimation. It also addresses statistical disclosure control issues and analyses issues that may have an effect on the comparability of the survey data across countries and across waves.",

        "abstract": "Defined benefit (DB) pensions and Social Security are important resources for financing retirement in the USA. However, these illiquid, nonmarket forms of wealth are typically excluded from measures of net worth. To the extent that these broadly held resources substitute for savings, measures of wealth inequality that do not account for DB pensions and Social Security may be overstated. This article develops an alternative, expanded wealth concept, augmenting net worth data from the Survey of Consumer Finances with estimates of DB pension and expected Social Security wealth. We explore the concentration of wealth among households ages 40--59 and find that (i) including DB pension and Social Security results in markedly lower measures of wealth concentration and (ii) trends toward higher wealth inequality over time, while moderated, are still present. Simulation exercises show that reductions in Social Security benefits significantly increase wealth concentration for the youngest birth-year cohorts.",

        "abstract": "Using administrative wealth records from Denmark, we study the effects of wealth taxes on wealth accumulation. Denmark used to impose one of the world's highest marginal tax rates on wealth, but this tax was greatly reduced starting in 1989 and later abolished. Due to the specific design of the wealth tax, the 1989 reform provides a compelling quasi-experiment for understanding behavioral responses among the wealthiest segments of the population. We find clear reduced-form effects of wealth taxes in the short and medium run, with larger effects on the very wealthy than on the moderately wealthy. We develop a simple life cycle model with utility of residual wealth (bequests) allowing us to interpret the evidence in terms of structural primitives. We calibrate the model to the quasi-experimental moments and simulate the model forward to estimate the long-run effect of wealth taxes on wealth accumulation. Our simulations show that the long-run elasticity of taxable wealth with respect to the net-of-tax return is sizable at the top of the distribution.",

        "abstract": "This study surveys the existing debate on the taxation of the intergenerational transfers. Understanding the effect of transfer taxes on the intergenerational transmission of wealth requires answering the difficult question of what is the effect of taxes on bequest. On the one hand, the economic literature is far from sharing a unanimous view on the exact nature of the motive to leave bequests. On the other, data problems, and in particular lack of data on donors, makes it hard to provide conclusive evidence on the matter. To put the debate in context, we review the legislation on the taxation of intergenerational transfers in several OECD countries. Institutional arrangements on estate taxations vary widely between countries. Despite such heterogeneity, the revenues from taxing intergen- erational transfers are generally low, and decreasing from 1\\% in the mid-sixties to 0.4\\% after 1980. We take this trend as broadly indicative that little redistribution takes place through taxation of intergenerational transfers. The available evidence and the related theoretical issues make it hard to establish a causal link between the increase in wealth and income inequality and the vanishing transfer tax.",

        "abstract": "Combining data from surveys, inheritance tax records, and rich lists, we estimate top wealth shares for Australia from World War I until the present day. We find that the top 1 percent share declined by two-thirds from 1915 until the late 1960s, and rose from the late 1970s to 2010. The recent increase is sharpest at the top of the distribution, with the top 0.001 percent wealth share tripling from 1984 to 2012. The trend in top wealth shares is similar to that in Australian top income shares (though the drop in the first half of the twentieth century is larger for wealth than income shares). Since the early twentieth century, top wealth shares in Australia have been lower than in the U.K. and U.S.",

Based on these estimates, the main findings are as follows. First, the top 1\\% (or 10\\%) of the adult population aged 20 and above owned 24\\% (or 63\\%) of total wealth for 2000--2007 and 25\\% (or 66\\%) for 2010--2013. Wealth concentration was much higher than income concentration, which was 12.1\\% (or 44.1\\%). Second, the wealth concentration in South Korea was lower than Anglo Saxon countries but somewhat higher than European continental countries such as France, falling in the middle of these two groups. A similar international status was true of income concentration. Third, Statistics Korea's Survey of Household Finances and Living Conditions does not adequately cover the financial assets of the top wealth brackets and consequently underestimates wealth inequality.",

        "abstract": "Inequality has become a central policy issue across the world. We study trends of inequality in earnings, income and wealth across households in Japan, using the National Survey of Family Income and Expenditure (NSFIE) from 1984 to 2014. We focus on the transition of inequality unconditionally and conditionally across various dimensions of household heterogeneity such as age, cohort, employment and marital status of household heads, sources of income, family size, etc. Inequality in earnings, income and wealth all increased during the last three decades. Changes in earnings and income inequality were mostly driven by demographic shift in the population towards the elderly, who tend to have higher inequality. Wealth inequality rose not only in the aggregate but also among the young, and this is due to a major increase in the fraction of households who own zero or very low wealth across all age groups. Critical factors in understanding inequality trends in Japan that we identified are aging demographics, changes in typical household structure, and macroeconomic trends of the past decades including the financial bubble period and a decades-long slow-down thereafter.",

Given empirical findings, bequests of these individuals generate almost the entire revenues from wealth transfer taxation. Due to this, their specific preferences prove to be decisive for the optimal taxation of bequests.

We also explain how we implement the approaches for demographic adjustment and how we identify hand-to-mouth households in the data. Section B discusses the coverage of the SCF+ at the top of the income and wealth distribution. Section C discusses evidence on mobility between wealth groups based on Panel Study of Income Dynamics (PSID) data. Section D provides sensitivity tests for Gini coefficients excluding negative wealth or income observations and for imputing rental income from owner-occupied housing. Section E provides additional results on Gini coefficients for different asset classes, a decomposition of house price exposure for different wealth groups over time, and presents time series for income and wealth shares, Gini coefficients for income and wealth, and for the portfolio composition along the wealth distribution.",

The household-level data allow us to study the joint distributions of household income and wealth since 1949. We expose the central importance of portfolio composition and asset prices for wealth dynamics in postwar America. Asset prices shift the wealth distribution because the composition and leverage of household portfolios differ systematically along the wealth distribution. Middle-class portfolios are dominated by housing, while rich households predominantly own equity. An important consequence is that the top and the middle of the distribution are affected differentially by changes in equity and house prices. Housing booms lead to substantial wealth gains for leveraged middle-class households and tend to decrease wealth inequality, all else equal. Stock market booms primarily boost the wealth of households at the top of the distribution. This race between the equity market and the housing market shaped wealth dynamics in postwar America and decoupled the income and wealth distribution over extended periods. The historical data also reveal that no progress has been made in reducing income and wealth inequalities between black and white households over the past 70 years, and that close to half of all American households have less wealth today in real terms than the median household had in 1970.",

        "abstract": "Since 1976, the federal transfer tax system has included an estate tax, gift tax, and generation-skipping tax. The estate and gift transfer taxes have been part of the federal revenue system, off and on, since the earliest days of the United States. With the enactment of the Economic Growth and Tax Relief Reconciliation Act of 2001 (P.L. 107-16), we are entering the first off period since 1916. This Act phases out the estate and generation-skipping taxes over a ten year period, leaving the gift tax as the only federal transfer tax. It must be kept in mind that the repeal of the estate and generation-skipping taxes is not permanent. The primary focus of proposed legislation in this area in the 108th Congress is on either making the repeal permanent or reinstating these taxes at lower rates in a manner more considerate of family owned business. In this report, the history of the federal transfer taxes, has been divided into four parts: (1) the federal death and gift taxes utilized in the period 1789 to 1915; (2) the development of the modern estate and gift taxes from 1916 through 1975; (3) the creation and refinement of a unified estate and gift tax system, supplemented by a generation-skipping transfer tax; and (4) the phase out and repeal of the estate and generation-skipping taxes, with the gift tax being retained as a device to protect the integrity of the income tax.",

        "abstract": "This paper presents new estimates of wealth inequality in Sweden during 2000--2012, linking wealth register data up to 2007 and individually capitalized wealth based on income and property tax registers for the period thereafter when a repeal of the wealth tax stopped the collection of individual wealth statistics. We find that wealth inequality increased after 2007 and that more unequal bank holdings and housing appear to be important drivers. We also evaluate the performance of the capitalization method by contrasting its estimates and their dispersion with observed stocks in register data up to 2007. The goodness-of-fit varies tremendously across assets and we conclude that although capitalized wealth estimates may well approximate overall inequality levels and trends, they are highly sensitive to assumptions and the quality of the underlying data sources.",

The super-rich have lowered their income taxes, shifting the tax burden to regressive sales taxes. They have reduced (or abolished) inheritance taxes. Corporate executives have aggressively moved their income into lower-taxed capital gains taxes, growing tax burdens for everybody else. Corporations have established subsidiaries globally, many of them in tax havens, avoiding corporate taxes altogether or waiting for a tax holiday. Corporations have routinely used transfer pricing to shift profits to low tax regimes, and losses to high tax regimes, allowing them to reduce or eliminate domestic taxes. And some corporations have declared that they have no tax home, and minimal tax liabilities, because their profits are held somewhere in virtual space.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies the determinants of wealth inequality during housing booms and busts. I examine two episodes over the last four decades in Spain by combining fiscal data with household surveys and national accounts. I find that heterogeneity in capital gains is the main driver behind the fall in wealth inequality during housing booms, while heterogeneity in saving rates and portfolio choices are the main explanatory forces of the rise in wealth concentration during housing busts. Top wealth holders are better at timing the market and reshuffling their portfolios, as they appear to be subject to less portfolio adjustment frictions.",

It also describes the proposal that was recently presented to establish a new tax in Mexico. The purpose of this article is to contribute theoretical elements to the debate about the relevance of establishing a tax on inheritance in Mexico.",

        "abstract": "Despite the recent downturn in the stock market, the 1990s boom and the shift to defined contribution plans mean that more individuals will have significant wealth upon retirement. How they use that wealth will determine not only their own well-being, but also the living standards of their children, the resources available to philanthropies, and the level of investment capital in the economy. This volume explores the reasons why people save, how they decide to allocate their wealth once they retire, and how givers select their beneficiaries. It also assesses the extent to which the estate tax and annuitization of retirement wealth affects the amount and nature of wealth transfers. Finally, it looks at the impact of wealth transfersfirst on the amount of aggregate saving and capital accumulation, and then on the distribution of wealth among households. Several conclusions emerge. First, gifts and bequests are important; they may account for about half of total wealth in America. Second, rich people make most of the wealth transfers. They are thoughtful about how much they pay in taxes and how they dispose of their wealth. They care about philanthropic causes and view their charitable contributions as more than a way to avoid paying estate taxes. Third, most nonrich people probably have some lexicographic preferences about the disposition of their wealth; they want to ensure they have adequate resources to take care of their own needs, and if money is left over, they would like it to go to their children. Fourth, little support has emerged for the pure altruistic model of bequests. Fifth, institutions matter. In the case of the rich, the estate tax probably reduces saving and increases bequests to charity. In the case of the nonrich, the shift to defined contribution plans will at a minimum mean that they have more wealth in their hands when they die, and therefore they will leave larger accidental bequests. It might also increase their interest in leaving an estate for their heirs. Saving and bequest behavior remains a fertile ground for future research. Major differences of opinion remain on such important issues as the effect of bequests on the distribution of wealth. The contributors to this volume provide a summary of existing knowledge, push the debate forward, and link topics in a unique and comprehensive way. At the same time, they make clear that many questions remain unresolved about the motives for and effects of wealth transfers.",

        "abstract": "This paper combines national accounts, survey, wealth and fiscal data (including recently released tax data on high-income taxpayers) in order to provide consistent series on the accumulation and distribution of income and wealth in Russia from the Soviet period until the present day. We find that official survey-based measures vastly under-estimate the rise of inequality since 1990. According to our benchmark estimates, top income shares are now similar to (or higher than) the levels observed in the United States. We also find that inequality has increased substantially more in Russia than in China and other ex-communist countries in Eastern Europe. We relate this finding to the specific transition strategy followed in Russia. According to our benchmark estimates, the wealth held offshore by rich Russians is about three times larger than official net foreign reserves, and is comparable in magnitude to total household financial assets held in Russia.",

        "abstract": "The report explores the role that inheritance taxation could play in raising revenues, addressing inequalities and improving efficiency in OECD countries. It provides background on the distribution and evolution of household wealth and inheritances, assesses the case for and against inheritance taxation drawing on existing theoretical and empirical literature, and examines the design of inheritance, estate and gift taxes in OECD countries. The report concludes with a number of reform options that governments could consider to improve the design and functioning of wealth transfer taxes.",

        "abstract": "While much of the comparative evidence on inequalities that is currently available refers to household income, wealth is a critical dimension of households' economic well-being. How wealth is distributed is important for equity and inter-generational mobility, but also for the stability of the economic system and for its resilience to shocks. While the lack of comparative evidence in this field reflects the absence of an agreed standard that statistical offices could use when collecting this information, this gap has been addressed by the OECD with the release in 2013 of a set of statistical guidelines in this field. In 2013, the OECD issued a set of `Guidelines' for micro statistics on household wealth (OECD, 2013) and an increasing number of countries have engaged in the collection of micro statistics in this field (European Central Bank, 2013). Building on these initiatives as well as others, such as the Luxembourg Wealth Study (Sierminska et al, 2006) which have informed previous OECD analysis (Jantii et al., 2008), the OECD has updated the data on the distribution of household wealth for OECD countries, based on the set of conventions and classifications proposed in the 2013 OECD Guidelines.",

        "abstract": "THE INHERITANCE TAX LAW OF OHIO. The direct inheritance tax law in this state, 108 O. L. 561, was signed by the governor on the 5th day of June, 1919, and went into effect immediately, being an act providing for a tax levy and hence not subject to the referendum. It was amended by a subsequent act of the General Assembly, 108 O. L. 1192, which was filed in the office of the secretary of state on the 17th day of February, 1920. This amending act was subject to the referendum and did not go into effect until May 17th following. In 1921 a supplementary act, 109 O. L. 521, was passed containing what was designated as Sec. 5348-11. This went into effect on Sep- tember 6, 1921, and has caused a duplication of sectional numbers which the attorney general sought to avoid by numbering the new section 5348-10a. A further amendment was made in 1923, 110 O. L. 26, which took effect on the 8th day of July, 1923. Herewith is given a copy of the law containing all the changes made and as it was effective in Ohio on and after the last mentioned date.",

Inequality increased until 1914 because industrial and financial estates grew dramatically. Then, adverse shocks, rather than a Kuznets-type process, led to a massive decline in inequality. The very high wealth concentration prior to 1914 benefited retired individuals living off capital income (rentiers) rather than entrepreneurs. The very rich were in their seventies and eighties, whereas they had been in their fifties a half century earlier and would be so again after World War II. Our results shed new light on ongoing debates about wealth inequality and growth.",

        "abstract": "This paper attempts to document and account for the long run evolution of inheritance. We find that in a country like France the annual flow of inheritance was about 20\\%-25\\% of national income between 1820 and 1910, down to less than 5\\% in 1950, and back up to about 15\\% by 2010. A simple theoretical model of wealth accumulation, growth and inheritance can fully account for the observed U-shaped pattern and levels. Using this model, we find that under plausible assumptions the annual bequest flow might reach about 20\\%-25\\% of national income by 2050. This corresponds to a capitalized bequest share in total wealth accumulation well above 100\\%. Our findings illustrate the fact that when the growth rate g is small, and when the rate of return to private wealth r is permanently and substantially larger than the growth rate (say, r=4\\%-5\\% vs. g=1\\%-2\\%), which was the case in the 19th century and early 20th century and is likely to happen again in the 21st century, then past wealth and inheritance are bound to play a key role for aggregate wealth accumulation and the structure of lifetime inequality. Contrarily to a widely spread view, modern economic growth did not kill inheritance.",

We provide sharp upward revision of official inequality estimates. The top 10 percent income share rose from 27 percent to 41 percent between 1978 and 2015; the bottom 50 percent share dropped from 27 percent to 15 percent. China's inequality levels used to be close to Nordic countries and are now approaching US levels.",

        "abstract": "The objective of this paper is to better understand the evolution and institutional roots of Hong Kong's growing economic inequality and political cleavages. By combining multiple sources of data (household surveys, fiscal data, wealth rankings, national accounts) and methodological innovations, two main findings are obtained. First, he evidence suggests a very large rise in income and wealth inequality in Hong Kong over the last four decades. Second, based on the latest opinion poll data, business elites, who carry disproportionate weight in Hong Kong's Legislative Council, are found to be more likely to vote for the pro-establishment camp (presumably to ensure that policies are passed that protect their political and economic interests). This paper argues that the unique alliance of government and business elites in a partially democratic political system is the plausible institutional root of Hong Kong's rising inequality and political cleavages.",

        "abstract": "We present an empirical model of wealth transfer taxation in the revenue systems of the G7 countries---Canada, France, Germany, Italy, Japan, the UK, and the US---over the period from 1965 to 2009. Our model emphasizes the influences of population aging and of the stock of household wealth in an explanation of the past and likely future of this tax source. Simulations with the model using U.N. demographic projections and projections of household wealth suggest that even in France and Germany where reliance on wealth transfer taxation has been increasing for part of the period studied, wealth transfer taxes can be expected to wither away as population aging deepens over the next two decades. Our results indicate that recent tax designs that rely upon the taxation of wealth transfers to preserve equity in the face of declining taxation of capital incomes may be, in this respect, politically infeasible for the foreseeable future. We conclude by using the case of wealth transfer taxation to raise the general question of the extent to which the consistency of a proposed reform with expected political equilibria ought to play a role in the design of a normative policy blueprint.",

It identifies both the degree of current use and the potential for increased use of (1) general and selective sales and gross receipts taxes, (2) death and gift taxes, (3) property taxes, (4) individual and corporation income taxes, (5) motor fuel taxes, (6) severance taxes, and (7) license and other miscellaneous taxes, on a State by State basis. Interstate comparisons of the amount of tax capacity and the degree of tax effort are accompanied by a discussion of considerations and limitations inherent in such comparisons. A bibliography of major tax studies in other States and regions is appended. (DE)",

        "abstract": "We study wealth concentration in Sweden over 130 years, from the beginning of industrialization until the present day. Our series are based on new evidence from estate and wealth tax data, foreign and domestic family firm-wealth, and pension wealth estimates. We find that Swedish wealth concentration was high in the agrarian state, and changed little during early industrialization. From World War I until about 1950, the richest percentile lost ground to high-income earners in the rest of the top-wealth decile. This equalization continued postwar; the entire top decile lost-out relative to the rest of the population. Around 1980, wealth compression stopped and inequality increased. We approximate the effects of international flows and find that the recent increase in wealth inequality is probably larger than what official estimates suggest.",

        "abstract": "This chapter reviews the long-run developments in the distribution of personal income and wealth. It also discusses suggested explanations for the observed patterns. We try to answer questions such as: What do we know, and how do we know, about the distribution of income and wealth over time? Are there common trends across countries or over the path of development? How do the facts relate to proposed theories about changes in inequality? We present the main inequality trends, in some cases starting as early as in the late eighteenth century, combining previous research with recent findings in the so-called top income literature and new evidence on wealth concentration. The picture that emerges shows that inequality was historically high almost everywhere at the beginning of the twentieth century. In some countries this situation was preceded by increasing concentration, but in most cases inequality seems to have been relatively constant at a high level in the nineteenth century. Over the twentieth century inequality decreased almost everywhere for the first 80 years, largely due to decreasing wealth concentration and decreasing capital incomes in the top of the distribution. Thereafter trends became more divergent across countries and also different across income and wealth distributions. Econometric evidence over the long run suggests that top shares increase in periods of above-average growth, whereas democracy and high marginal tax rates are associated with lower top shares.",

        "abstract": "This paper combines income tax returns with macroeconomic household balance sheets to estimate the distribution of wealth in the United States since 1913. We estimate wealth by capitalizing the incomes reported by individual taxpayers, accounting for assets that do not generate taxable income. We successfully test our capitalization method in three micro datasets where we can observe both income and wealth: the Survey of Consumer Finance, linked estate and income tax returns, and foundations' tax records. We find that wealth concentration was high in the beginning of the twentieth century, fell from 1929 to 1978, and has continuously increased since then. The top 0.1\\% wealth share has risen from 7\\% in 1978 to 22\\% in 2012, a level almost as high as in 1929. Top wealth-holders are younger today than in the 1960s and earn a higher fraction of the economy's labor income. The bottom 90\\% wealth share first increased up to the mid-1980s and then steadily declined. The increase in wealth inequality in recent decades is due to the upsurge of top incomes combined with an increase in saving rate inequality. We explain how our findings can be reconciled with Survey of Consumer Finances and estate tax data.",

        "abstract": "This paper discusses the progressive taxation of household wealth. We first discuss what wealth is, how it is distributed, and how much revenue a progressive wealth tax could generate in the United States. We try to reconcile discrepancies across wealth data sources. Second, we discuss the role a wealth tax can play to increase the overall progressivity of the U.S. tax system. Third, we discuss the empirical evidence on wealth tax avoidance and evasion as well as tax enforcement policies. We summarize the key elements needed to make a U.S. wealth tax work in light of the experience of other countries. Fourth, we discuss the real economic effects of wealth taxation on inequality, the capital stock, and economic activity. Fifth, we present a simple tractable model of the taxation of billionaires' wealth that can be applied to the Forbes list of the four hundred richest Americans since 1982 to illustrate the long-run effects of concrete wealth tax proposals on top fortunes.",

We use these distributional macroeconomic accounts to quantify the rise of income and wealth concentration since the late 1970s, the change in tax progressivity, and the direct redistributive effects of government intervention in the economy. Between 1978 and 2018, the share of pre-tax income earned by the top 1 percent rose from 10 percent to about 19 percent, and the share of wealth owned by the top 0.1 percent rose from 7 percent to about 18 percent. In 2018, the tax system was regressive at the top-end; the top 400 wealthiest Americans paid a lower average tax rate than the macroeconomic tax rate of 29 percent. We confront our methods and findings with those of other studies, pinpoint the areas where more research is needed, and describe how additional data collection could improve inequality measurement.",

        "abstract": "This paper studies inequality in America through the lens of distributional macroeconomic accounts---comprehensive distributions of the aggregate amount of income and wealth recorded in the official macroeconomic accounts of the United States. We use these distributional macroeconomic accounts to quantify the rise of income and wealth concentration since the late 1970s, the change in tax progressivity, and the direct redistributive effects of government intervention in the economy. Between 1978 and 2018, the share of pre-tax income earned by the top 1\\% rose from 10\\% to about 19\\% and the share of wealth owned by the top 0.1\\% rose from 7\\% to about 18\\%. In 2018, the tax system was regressive at the top end; the top 400 wealthiest Americans paid a lower average tax rate than the macroeconomic tax rate of 29\\%. We confront our methods and findings with those of other studies, pinpoint the areas where more research is needed, and describe how additional data collection could improve inequality measurement.",

        "abstract": "Recent studies argue that US inequality has increased less than previously thought, in particular due to a more modest rise of wealth and capital income at the top (Smith et al., 2019; Smith, Zidar and Zwick, 2020; Auten and Splinter, 2019). We examine the claims made in these papers point by point, separating genuine improvements from arguments that do not appear to us well grounded empirically or conceptually. Taking stock of this body of work, and factoring in other improvements, we provide a comprehensive update of our estimates of US income and wealth inequality. Although some of the points raised by the revisionists are valuable, the core quantitative findings of this literature do not appear to be supported by the data. The low capital share of private business income estimated in Smith et al. (2019) is not consistent with the large capital stock of these businesses. In Smith, Zidar and Zwick (2020), the interest rate assigned to the wealthy is higher than in the datasets where both income and wealth can be observed, leading to downward biased top wealth shares; capitalizing equities using almost only dividends dramatically underestimates the wealth of billionaires relative to the Forbes 400. In Auten and Splinter (2019), business profits earned by the top 1\\% but not taxable (due in particular to generous depreciation rules) are classified as tax evasion; tax evasion is then allocated to the bottom 99\\% based on an erroneous reading of random audit data. Our revised series show a rise of inequality similar to Saez and Zucman (2016) and Piketty, Saez, and Zucman (2018) while allowing for a more granular depiction of the composition of wealth and income at the top.",

        "abstract": "We estimate the size of inheritance and gift flows in Germany for selected years over the last century, applying the methodology used by Piketty (2011) for France and combining national accounts, tax statistics and survey data (mainly the German Socio-Economic Panel, SOEP). The data clearly supports the finding of a U-shaped evolution. The annual flow of inheritance and gifts was almost 15\\% of national income in 1911 and declined to less then 2\\% by the middle of the last century. Over the last five decades, it has risen steadily to over 10\\% of national income in recent years, amounting to e220 billion in 2009. The pattern is close to the evolution in France, but at a slightly lower level. Evidence on transfers based on pure household survey data or inheritance tax statistics yields much lower values. We can decompose the gap between the taxed and the aggregate inheritance flow: controlling for valuation and tax evasion effects, the taxed flow would be at least twice as high; tax exemption effects account for the rest.

The present undervaluation of real estate and commercial assets is an infringement of the principle of equal and uniform taxation. At its present volume of around 3 billion euros inheritance tax only accounts for less than 1\\% of total tax revenues in Germany, but the trend is upward. The data from the Socio-Economic Panel (SOEP) compiled by DIW Berlin in conjunction with Infratest Sozialforschung now makes it possible to give estimates of the annual volume of inherited assets in a breakdown by socio-demographic factors. According to the SOEP estimates, around 1.5\\% of all private households in Germany currently have an annual increase in assets of on average 65 000 euros from inheritance. Just under a further one percent of all households receive annual gifts of on average 30 000 euros. These transfers amount to income to private households of about 50 billion euros annually, which is more than 2\\% of GDP.",

        "abstract": "The 1980s were hailed by many as the decade of tax reform. A number of different countries were caught by a neo-liberal tax reforming wave which saw rates of personal and corporate income taxes reduced, tax allowances restricted, tax bases broadened, the incidence between direct and indirect taxation shifted and tax structures simplified. Policy makers were driven to change tax systems for a number of reasons. There is a tendency, however, to point to economic factors as the cause, but this presents only part of the picture. Moreover, it tells us little about the process. How did tax reform come about. Where did the impulse come from. How did it emerge on political agendas. Tax reform measures were the outcome of positive political decisions to make a policy change. Therefore, it's primarily to the political context we must look for an explanation. While considering a broad range of competing models of politics, this paper will ultimately show that the complex of factors which constitute the tax reform process can best be explained by reference to problems, policies, politics and open windows in a given institutional setting. This hypothesis will be considered in light of the French and British experiences in the 1980s.",

        "abstract": "This paper uses administrative tax data to estimate top wealth in the United States. We build on the capitalization approach in Saez and Zucman (2016) while accounting for heterogeneity within asset classes when mapping income flows to wealth. Our approach reduces bias in wealth estimates because wealth and rates of return are correlated. We find that the top 0.1\\% share of wealth increased from 7\\% to 14\\% from 1978 to 2016. While this rise is half as large as prior estimates, wealth is very concentrated: the top 1\\% holds nearly as much wealth as the bottom 90\\%. However, the \"P90-99\" class holds more wealth than either group after accounting for heterogeneity. Private business and public equity wealth are the primary sources of wealth at the top, and pension and housing wealth account for almost all wealth of the bottom 90\\%. Our approach substantially reduces estimates of mechanical wealth tax revenue and top capital income in distributional national accounts, which depend on well-measured estimates of top wealth. From 1980 to 2014, capital income accounts for 2.4 out of 8.1 percentage points of the rise of the top 1\\% income share.",

        "abstract": "This article uses administrative tax data to estimate top wealth in the United States. We assemble new data that link people to their sources of capital income and develop new methods to estimate the degree of return heterogeneity within asset classes. Disaggregated fixed-income data reveal that rich individuals earn much more of their interest income in higher-yielding forms and have much greater exposure to credit risk. Consequently, in recent years, the interest rate on fixed income at the top is approximately 3.5 times higher than the average. We value the population of U.S. firms using firm-level characteristics and apportion this wealth using firm-owner links. We combine this new data on fixed income and pass-through business returns with refined estimates of C-corporation equity, housing, and pension wealth to deliver new capitalized wealth estimates that build upon the methods of Saez and Zucman (2016a). From 1989 to 2016, the top 1\\%, 0.1\\%, and 0.01\\% wealth shares increased by 6.6, 4.6, and 2.9 percentage points, respectively, to 33.7\\%, 15.7\\%, and 7.1\\%. Overall, although we estimate a large degree of return heterogeneity, accounting for this heterogeneity does not change the fundamental story for top wealth shares and their growth---wealth inequality is high and has risen substantially over recent decades.",

        "abstract": "This paper provides the first in-depth investigation into the evolution of the wealth gap between CCP and non-CCP households in urban China from 1995 to 2017. We apply unconditional quantile regression to analyze the variations in the premiums of party membership across the wealth distribution. Our results show that although the average wealth gap between CCP and non-CCP households remained substantial and consistent throughout the period, there have been significant shifts in the returns structure of party membership over time. Prior to the housing reform in the 1990s, the highest wealth premiums of CCP households were primarily concentrated in the middle of the distribution, but now they are concentrated at the bottom of the distribution. This is mainly attributed to the fact that CCP households at the lower end of the net wealth distribution are more inclined to possess housing assets, which tend to have higher value compared to those owned by non-CCP households. These effects fade out in the top half of the net wealth distribution, where the differences between CCP and non-CCP households become less apparent. Furthermore, by utilizing a balanced household panel from 2013 to 2017, we were able to track wealth accumulation at the household level. Our findings indicate that CCP households accumulate wealth faster than non-CCP households due to larger capital gains, and the differences between the two groups increase along the net wealth distribution.",

Listing the year and the mode of the first permanent introduction of six major taxes (inheritance tax, personal income tax, corporate income tax, social security contributions, general sales tax and value added tax) in 220 countries, 1750--2018, TID is the most comprehensive dataset of its kind. The comprehensiveness of our measure is of critical value to empirical work on the causes of tax innovation and its consequences for state, society and economy. In this paper, we explain the selection of our tax sample and the structure of the dataset, descriptively map temporal and regional patterns of tax introductions around the world, and draw on TID to investigate associations between tax introductions and economic development, war, and democratization.",

        "abstract": "We analyze the evolution of aggregate household wealth, its composition, and top wealth shares since the mid-19th century for the Netherlands, a country which played a significant role in economic history. The main forces at play are the size and variation of colonial wealth up until WWII, and the introduction of a --particularly strong-- pension system thereafter. We show that the wealth-income ratio followed the familiar U-shaped pattern over the 20th century. The Netherlands, however, had the largest wealth-income ratio on record, growing since the mid-1850s, driven by industrialization and booming private foreign investments, to a peak of 900\\% around 1880. In contrast to other countries, the wealth-income ratio remained high up until 1929. To better understand these trends, we construct the first series on colonial wealth and show that colonial and other foreign investment account for most of the gap with other countries in the pre-WWII period. The initial post-war decline in the ratio is driven by rapid income growth. The increase in the ratio since the 1970s has been mainly driven by the uniquely large capital-funded pension system. In contrast with other major countries, housing plays only a secondary role in net wealth accumulation due to significant mortgage debt. Methodologically, we are the first to compare historical national accounts, estate multiplier, and wealth tax data approaches to construct aggregate wealth. We find that the estate multiplier is a good alternative to the historical national accounts benchmark, while the use of wealth tax data results in unrealistically low estimates.",

        "abstract": "This paper reviews the available evidence on post-war trends in Dutch private wealth inequality using a range of scattered sources. Wealth tax records suggest a substantial decline in inequality to the 1970s and, more tentatively, a gradual rise thereafter. In the post-1990 years, Gini-coefficients of private wealth inequality range from 0.8 to 0.9, which is at the high end of the international comparison. Such high levels of private wealth inequality contrast with relatively low levels of net income inequality; a paradox that the Netherlands share with other Northern European welfare states. We hypothesise that publicly funded life-time income security limits the wealth-formation by ordinary Dutch households, while the redistributive taxes required to finance this system are targeting income rather than wealth.",

Using Monte Carlo evidence, I show that adding only a few extreme observations to wealth surveys is sufficient to remove the downward bias. Combining extreme wealth observations from Forbes World's billionaires with the Survey of Consumer Finances, the Wealth and Assets Survey, and the Household Finance and Consumption Survey, I provide new improved estimates of top tail wealth in the United States, the United Kingdom, and nine euro area countries. These new estimates indicate significantly higher top wealth shares than those calculated from the wealth surveys alone.",

        "abstract": "Theoretical models show that financial inclusion reduces wealth inequality. Existing empirical models are restricted to estimates using income inequality because of a lack of cross country wealth inequality data. We used 2010-11 and 2014-5 waves of the National Income Dynamics Study combined with South African tax records to estimate wealth and income inequality. Using Re-centered Influence Function regressions on the micro-level records, we confirmed the negative cross-country relationship between financial inclusion and income inequality. Wealth inequality is different. Financial inclusion improved wealth shares of only the middle class. Because of predatory lending, expansion of credit reduced the wealth share of the poor. Improved savings by the middle class, providing better oversight over financial services targeted at the poor and removing impediments to the small business sector are pre-conditions for financial inclusion to reduce wealth inequality.",

The inequality of net worth, after almost two decades of little movement, went up sharply from 2007 to 2010, and relative indebtedness for the middle class expanded. The sharp fall in median net worth and the rise in overall wealth inequality over these years are largely traceable to the high leverage of middle class families and the high share of homes in their portfolio. Mean and median wealth rebounded from 2010 to 2016, by 17 and 28 percent, respectively. While mean wealth surpassed its previous peak in 2007, median wealth was still down by 34 percent. More than 100 percent of the recovery in both was due to a high return on wealth but this factor was offset by negative savings. Relative indebtedness continued to fall for the middle class from 2010 to 2016, and wealth inequality increased somewhat. The racial and ethnic disparity in wealth holdings widened considerably between 2007 and 2016, and the wealth of households under age 45 declined in relative terms.",

However, 2007 still remains the watershed year, and median wealth was down 20.4 percent relative to 2007, though mean wealth more than fully recovered. There was a modest remission in wealth inequality, with the share of the top one percent down by 1.4 percentage points, that of the top 20 percent down by 1.0 percentage points, the Gini coefficient down by 0.008, and the mean wealth of the top one percent also down by 1.9 percent. The homeownership rate finally rebounded a bit, by 1.2 percentage points, to 64.9 percent. The stock ownership rate advanced by 0.4 percentage points to 49.6 percent, though still down from its 2001 peak. Though the mean debt of the middle class rose by 10.7 percent in real terms, the debt-income and debt-net worth ratios remained largely unchanged. The black-white gap in mean net worth remained unchanged, as did the Hispanic-white wealth gap. The wealth of households under age 35 continued to deteriorate in both absolute and relative terms between 2016 and 2019.",

        "abstract": "In this article we use an original data set to provide the first empirical analysis of the political economy of inherited wealth taxation that covers a significant number of countries and a long time frame (1816--2000). Our goal is to understand why, if inheritance taxes are often very old taxes, the implementation of inheritance tax rates significant enough to affect wealth inequality is a much more recent phenomenon. We hypothesize alternatively that significant taxation of inherited wealth depended on (1) the extension of the suffrage and (2) political conditions created by mass mobilization for war. Using a difference-in-differences framework for identification, we find little evidence for the suffrage hypothesis but very strong evidence for the mass mobilization hypothesis. Our study has implications for understanding the evolution of wealth inequality and the political conditions under which countries are likely to implement policies that significantly redistribute wealth and income.",

        "abstract": "This article reviews the recent literature on the dynamics of global wealth inequality. I first reconcile available estimates of wealth inequality in the United States. Both surveys and tax data show that wealth inequality has increased dramatically since the 1980s, with a top 1\\% wealth share of approximately 40\\% in 2016 versus 25--30\\% in the 1980s. Second, I discuss the fast-growing literature on wealth inequality across the world. Evidence points toward a rise in global wealth concentration: For China, Europe, and the United States combined, the top 1\\% wealth share has increased from 28\\% in 1980 to 33\\% today, while the bottom 75\\% share hovered around 10\\%. Recent studies, however, may underestimate the level and rise of inequality, as financial globalization makes it increasingly hard to measure wealth at the top. I discuss how new data sources (leaks from financial institutions, tax amnesties, and macroeconomic statistics of tax havens) can be leveraged to better capture the wealth of the rich.",
